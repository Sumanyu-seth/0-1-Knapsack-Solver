💰 Knapsack Solver: Max Value Optimization

Project Overview

This repository provides an efficient solution for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using the Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. The goal is to maximize the total value of items selected without exceeding a set weight capacity.

✨ Core Solution Features

Optimal Result: Guarantees the globally maximum profit using bottom-up DP tabulation.

Complete Output: Returns both the maximum value and the list of item indices selected (via backtracking).

Efficient Complexity: Solved in pseudo-polynomial time to avoid exponential runtime.
